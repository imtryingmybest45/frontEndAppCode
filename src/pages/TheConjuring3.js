It is truly a travesty that this movie exists...I blame its mediocrity on James Wan's absence in the creative process. It's like a lousy redo of The Excorcism of Emily Rose (2005), where all of the unique history and lore was replaced with cheap special effects. Honestly, one of the worst movies in the Conjuring franchise. I once again direct you to read my review on The Conjuring 2 if you want an idea of what a true horror movie masterpiece is.</p>
