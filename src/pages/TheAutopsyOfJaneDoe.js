            <p style={{ whiteSpace: 'pre-wrap' }}>The Autopsy of Jane Doe is a great movie  because it traps you in that morgue right alongside the characters. The father son dynamic gives the whole thing a grounded feel as the mystery around the body keeps getting stranger. The storm outside and the cramped, underground setting make every little sound feel like a threat. It’s one of those horror films that gets under your skin.</p>
