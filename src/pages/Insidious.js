Thoughts:<br /> 
<br /> 
-I enjoyed the astral projection concept a lot; I thought that was very original.<br /> 
-The score is INCREDIBLE, 10/10. It's so infamous that the minute you hear it, you know you're watching an Insidious film<br /> 
-Lovable characters (Specs, Tucker, Elise). Specs and Tucker's antics give an overall dark and disturbing film some brief moments of levity<br /> 
-It's incredible how they basically filmed the entire movie in a house (well, technically two houses). I have mad respect for the production team for effectively constructing an entire spirit dimension on basically peanuts<br />
