Outline of general thoughts:
<br /> 
 <br />
1. A very strong debut of the Insidious franchise
2. I'm happy that Patrick Wilson is in it, he's great
3. Dalton is an idiot for falling down the attic
4. I need to get it so that I can put single spaces in my reviews, because when I submit this it's gonna show up as a space between every single number
5. Making websites is hard.</p>
