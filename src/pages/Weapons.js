This movie was alright…it was a novel concept, but I feel that the scares and the acting weren’t up to par. A friend of mine clocked it very accurately: “It had an interesting concept, but I don’t think I’d watch it again, especially now that I know the twist.” Now, a great movie with infinite rewatchability is the Conjuring 2, of which you should definitely read my review for.</p>
