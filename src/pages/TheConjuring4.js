A halfway decent Conjuring, not as bad as its predecessor, but not near as good as the first two installments. While the writers tried to find a coherent ending to the series, there were still some glaring inconsistencies in the plot that seemed to depart from what was established in the previous Conjurings. You should watch the Conjuring 2, which is one of the greatest horror movies of all time and whose review you should definitely read after this.</p>
